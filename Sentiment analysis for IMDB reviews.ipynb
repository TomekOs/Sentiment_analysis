    "**Project name:** Sentiment analysis for IMDB reviews <br>\n",
    "Autor: Tomasz Ostaszewicz <br>\n",
    "Implementation: pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:** This is sentiment analysis for IMDB reviews. The aim of the analysis is to predict if movie review form IMDB is positive or negative (binary classification problem). To predict sentiment different preprocessing schemes and machine learning and deep learning models were used, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Classical machine learning models:\n",
    "    1. Data preprocessing: removing stop words, removing punctuation, expanding contractions, stemming.\n",
    "    2. Model input data in the form of: Count variables, TFidf variables.\n",
    "    2. Models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, XGBoost.\n",
    "2. Deep learning models:\n",
    "    1. Data preprocessing: removing punctuation.\n",
    "    2. Model input data in the form of: Embeddings (from Glove model).\n",
    "    3. Models: Simple RNN, LSTM, LSTM Bidirectional, LSTM Bidirectional with dropout, GRU, GRU Bidirectional, GRU Bidirectional with dropout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions of analysis are presented at the end of each section."

    "#### Classical models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The best model among classical models is Logistic Regression which is slightly surprising. \n",
    "2. XGBoost and SVM are slightly worse (SVM is calculated on 500 variables resulting from SVD decomposition).\n",
    "3. It is possible that better tuning of hyperparameters for XGBoost and SVM could result in better performance (at least reaching logistic regression level).\n",
    "4. Using SVD to preselect variables for Logistic Regression gives unsatisfactory results.\n",
    "5. Logistic regression gives the best test accuracy score (0.87850)\n",
    "6. Using 1000 words as a base for estimation gives noticeable worse result than estimation on 5000 most popular words.\n",
    "7. Preprocessing data (expanding contraction, removing punctuation and stop words and using stemmer) gives slightly worse performance than data which are not preprocessed in any way.\n",
    "8. Using count vectorizer gives slightly worse performance than using TFidf Vectorizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### RNN models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Usually batch size 128 gives better results than batch size 32, but batch size 128 takes much more time to estimate.\n",
    "2. Usually estimation on 20000 words gives within model type the best results (comparing to 1000 and 5000 words).\n",
    "3. The best accuracy (0.90000) on test sample is reached by GRU Bidirectional with dropout model estimated on 128 batch size and 20000 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classical models vs RNN models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deep learning models on IMDB dataset perform better than classical models (except for Simple RNN).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kaggle tutorial competition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ROC_AUC value equal to 0.96446 (from GRU Bidirectional with dropout model) gives 39 position in Kaggle tutorial competition leader board (among 528 teams).\n",
    "2. ROC_AUC for Logistic regression model is 0.88176 which is significantly worse than result from GRU Bidirectional with dropout model (0.96446)."
